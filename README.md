Apple Calendar + Reminder workflow JS scripts

Hi guys, this is a working flow code piece based on Apple Calendar, Reminders, and Scriptable. It is a work in progress and I will be adding more to it as I go. I am using it to help me manage my life and I hope it helps you too.

I am using the following apps:
- Scriptable
- Reminders
- Calendar
- Shortcuts

## Here are some of the features:
- Create a new calendar event with a reminder
- One direction sync between calendar and reminder (reminder to calendar)
- Update the reminder and calendar's icons according to the due date and completeness
  - ✅: Completed
  - ⭕️: Due today
  - ❌: Overdue
  - no icon: Not due yet

## More to come!
- Create a new calendar event with a reminder and its note syntax
- Start Pomodoro timer with a reminder and record the time spent on the task, then add it to the reminder's note
- According to the reminder's note, summarize the time spent on the task and output to Notes to create daily reports (I am using this to track my time spent on each task)

## I am working on:
- Support for recurring reminders showing up on the calendar
- Support for reminder notes' syntax to create a new calendar event
- etc

## How to use
**JUST BASIC USAGES FOR NOW, WILL UPDATE MORE LATER**(I am so lazy to write a detailed guide, sorry)
1. Download the script and import it into Scriptable
2. Create a new automation and add the following actions:
   - Run Scriptable Script when reminders or calendar is opened or closed

If you have any suggestions or questions, please let me know! I am open to any feedback and I am happy to help you out.
You could simply open an issue or contact me via email.

## Looking for volunteers to give feedback and help me test the script. If you are interested, please contact me. Thanks!
